I worked with Katie Emerson, a first-year computer science student at Wellesley College, to create a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees problem using coupled harmonic oscillators as described in this paper. We were able to create an implementation using the Classiq software development kit that works for up to 10 qubits efficiently, equivalent to 512 columns per tree. As a winner of the research exchange, I had the opportunity to present our results to Classiq on May 28th, 2024.\nI then worked with Classiq, a quantum computing software company, to create a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees algorithm that can run on real quantum hardware for qubit sizes too large to simulate. I created an algorithm that can run for an arbitrary number of qubits, as well as an educational website that introduces the problem and describes my implementation. The algorithm is featured as part of the Classiq library and documentation. I also wrote an article for Classiq describing the algorithm.\nFeel free to view the website and GitHub repository.\niQuHACK 2024: QuEra Challenge February 2024 I won second place at iQuHACK 2024, the annual MIT quantum computing hackathon. Working with four other students from Northeastern and Yale, I investigated the maximum independent set problem with vertices connecting edges up to three times the lattice constant in a square graph. We used Aquila, QuEra\u0026rsquo;s 256-qubit quantum computer, along with Bloqade, QuEra\u0026rsquo;s software development kit. I did most of the programming for the team, using both Julia to perform classical simulations and Python to interact with the quantum hardware.\nFeel free to view our documentation and GitHub repository.\n","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/projects/","section":"Adam Godel","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
