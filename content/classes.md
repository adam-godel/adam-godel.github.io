A study of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and works by Rembrandt add an artistic lens to our studies. A focus on writing and research complements our emphasis on authorship. ***(Received an A)***

## Summer 2024
As part of BU Philhellenes, a study abroad program in Greece from July 1st to August 9th, I took the following 200-level philosophy course at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The course was not graded.

### Virtue and the Virtues of a Leader in Ancient Greek Philosophy
In this course we intend to examine thoroughly the set of virtues that any successful leader should feature; to this purpose we will discuss the Platonic, the Aristotelian and the Epicurean tradition as dominant trends pervading late antiquity, the Byzantine period, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (in Europe as well as in other cultural settings), up to our era. Our focus will fall upon the practical virtues and the skills a successful leader should possess; to this purpose it will be of great importance to underpin various significant affinities between the philosophical traditions of the West and those of the East, with particular emphasis on Confucius’ and Mencius’ views.
