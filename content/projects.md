## Past Projects

### Directed Reading Program: Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics <br/> <small><i>January 2025 - May 2025</i></small>
I participated in the BU math department's directed reading program, where I met weekly with PhD student John Ivanhoe. Using John Conway's <i>A Course in Functional Analysis</i> and David Griffiths' <i>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</i>, we built up a physical intuition for mathematical concepts such as the Fourier Transform through derivations of solutions for the Schrödinger equation and the uncertainty principle. We also looked at the quantum phase estimation algorithm. The meetings culminated in a 10 minute presentation to the BU math department at the end of the semester.

### YQuantum 2025: Travelers-Capgemini Challenge <br/> <small><i>April 2025</i></small>
I participated in YQuantum 2025, the annual Yale quantum computing hackathon, to investigate the viability of a recursive search maximum independent set algorithm for graph coloring and its applicability to risk minimization in insurance. We used the Los Angeles County Fire Hazard Zones database to simulate 20–200 acre zones with a certain wildfire severity level as graphs, creating an algorithmic approach that better ensures that insurance companies diversify their portfolios.

### iQuHACK 2025: Alice & Bob Challenge <br/> <small><i>February 2025</i></small>
I won second place at iQuHACK 2025, the annual MIT quantum computing hackathon. Working with four other students from BU, I investigated the quantum physics of cat qubits, the qubit model used by Alice & Bob in hopes of reducing bit flip errors at the cost of only a small increase of phase flip errors. We put ourselves in the shoes of an Alice & Bob quantum engineer for 24 hours, working on modeling Wigner plots of concepts such as Zeno gates, quantum decoherence, and parametric optimizations.

### CGSA Website <br/> <small><i>August 2024 - December 2024</i></small>
I worked on this project to revamp the website of the BU Center for Gender, Sexuality & Activism as lead software engineer for BU Hack4Impact. The website includes native forms and a blog section with an admin page where site admins can view form responses and make blog posts that are also automatically emailed to students in their newsletter. The site was made using React and NodeJS, and uses MongoDB, Netlify, and Heroku for hosting.

### Glued Trees <br/> <small><i>March 2024 - June 2024</i></small>
I was selected as a winner of QRISE 2024, the Quantum Research & Industry Skills Exchange. I worked with Katie Emerson, a first-year computer science student at Wellesley College, to create a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees problem using coupled harmonic oscillators as described in [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041041). We were able to create an implementation using the Classiq software development kit that works for up to 10 qubits efficiently, equivalent to 512 columns per tree. As a winner of the research exchange, I had the opportunity to present our results to Classiq on May 28th, 2024. 

I then worked with Classiq, a quantum computing software company, to create a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees algorithm that can run on real quantum hardware for qubit sizes too large to simulate. I created an algorithm that can run for an arbitrary number of qubits, as well as an educational website that introduces the problem and describes my implementation. The algorithm is featured as part of the Classiq [library](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library/tree/main/algorithms/glued_trees) and [documentation](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/glued_trees/glued_trees). I also wrote an [article](https://www.classiq.io/insights/exponential-quantum-speedup-on-even-todays-quantum-computers-glued-trees-algorithm) for Classiq describing the algorithm.

### iQuHACK 2024: QuEra Challenge <br/> <small><i>February 2024</i></small>
I won second place at iQuHACK 2024, the annual MIT quantum computing hackathon. Working with four other students from Northeastern and Yale, I investigated the maximum independent set problem with vertices connecting edges up to three times the lattice constant in a square graph. We used Aquila, QuEra's 256-qubit quantum computer, along with Bloqade, QuEra's software development kit. I did most of the programming for the team, using both Julia to perform classical simulations and Python to interact with the quantum hardware.
