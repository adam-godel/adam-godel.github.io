## Current Positions

### Researcher, BU CASP Systems Lab <br/> <small><i>December 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am a researcher at the BU Complex Analytics & Scalable Processing (CASP) Systems Lab working with three professors and three PhD students to investigate the implementation of a variety of efficient protocols under a secure multi-party computation setting. I help maintain the group’s expansive C++ library and devise cutting-edge efficient and provably secure applications of our primitives and access patterns. I aim to complete my first paper as part of the group by April 2026.

### Quantum Solutions Launchpad Fellow, WISER <br/> <small><i>April 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am a QSL Fellow at the Washington Institute for STEM, Entrepreneurship and Research working on the "Quantum Benchmarking of Majorana Systems" project in collaboration with the US Naval Nuclear Laboratory. This fellowship involves working on a professional quantum computing project with a few other students and mentors. The fellowship was paused between October 2025 and January 2026 due to federal funding freezes, but we have now returned and hope to complete our research and publish a paper and open-source library with our work over the coming months.

### Vice President, BU Hack4Impact <br/> <small><i>December 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am vice president of BU Hack4Impact, a web development club at Boston University and a student-led 501(c)(3) that develops software for nonprofits to meet their humanitarian needs. As part of this role, I oversee the club's web development workshops as well as web projects for nonprofits developed by 3-4 teams each semester. I also manage the operation and logistics of the club's executive board.

### Director, BU Quantum <br/> <small><i>September 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am the founder and director of BU Quantum, a quantum computing club at Boston University hosting weekly workshops introducing students to quantum computing concepts from both a theory and computational perspective. I lead all of the workshops, where participants learn about different fundamental concepts and algorithms in the field and then implement them using the Qiskit and Classiq software development kits. I also created weekly notes and addendums hosted on <a href="https://buquantum.org/" target="_blank">the club's website</a> to complement the weekly workshops.

### Grader, BU Math & CS Departments <br/> <small><i>September 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am a grader in the BU departments of mathematics and computer science, evaluating student homework assignments and giving detailed feedback in the form of comments. In Fall 2025, I graded for a 200-level mathematics course in addition to grading assignments and exams as a TA for CS112. In Spring 2026, I grade for a 300-level computer science course.

## Past Positions

### Software Engineer, CyQuant <br/> <small><i>May 2025 - July 2025</i></small>
I worked as a software engineer at CyQuant, a cyber risk insurance startup, in Paris. My primary task was to create an algorithm that quantifies insurance questionnaires based on a set of cybersecurity standards. I also rebuilt the <a href="https://cyquant.com" target="_blank">CyQuant website</a> from scratch, adding more modern design elements as well as account and job handling systems.

### Teaching Assistant, CS112: Introduction to Computer Science 2 <br/> <small><i>September 2025 - December 2025</i></small>
I served as a teaching assistant for the second semester introductory computer science course at BU, which is taught in Java and focuses on data structures. I took the course in Fall 2023 and received an A. I led two lab sections, graded exams, participated in weekly meetings with the professor, and held office hours to assist students with completing assignments and understanding key concepts of the course.

### Course Assistant, CS112: Introduction to Computer Science 2 <br/> <small><i>September 2024 - May 2025</i></small>
I served as a course assistant for the second semester introductory computer science course at BU, which is taught in Java and focuses on data structures. I took the course in Fall 2023 and received an A. I helped lead a lab section and held office hours to assist students with completing assignments and understanding key concepts of the course.

### Director of Engineering, BU Hack4Impact <br/> <small><i>December 2024 - December 2025</i></small>
As part of this role, I co-led BU Hack4Impact's Impact Program, managing 3-4 teams of student interns working on web development projects. I focused primarily on the software development side, hiring software engineers to populate the four teams and advising them on the expectations and responsibilities of their roles. The other part of my role involved instructing and managing weekly workshops covering web development and essential programming skills for students (primarily CS majors) aiming to establish a foothold in the field of software engineering for BU Hack4Impact's Junior Development Team.

### Lead Software Engineer, BU Hack4Impact <br/> <small><i>July 2024 - December 2024</i></small>
I served as lead software engineer for one of BU Hack4Impact's Impact Teams, a student-led 501(c)(3) that develops software for nonprofits to meet their humanitarian needs.
