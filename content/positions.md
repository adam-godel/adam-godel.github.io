## Current Positions

### Quantum Solutions Launchpad Fellow, WISER <br/> <small><i>April 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am a QSL Fellow at the Washington Institute for STEM, Entrepreneurship and Research working on the "Quantum Benchmarking of Majorana Systems" project in collaboration with the US Naval Nuclear Laboratory. This several month fellowship involves working on a professional quantum computing project with a few other students and mentors aiming to produce a publication and open-source library by the end of the experience.

### Teaching Assistant, CS112: Introduction to Computer Science 2 <br/> <small><i>September 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am serving as a teaching assistant for the second semester introductory computer science course at BU, which is taught in Java and focuses on data structures. I took the course in Fall 2023 and received an A. I lead two lab sections, grade exams, participate in weekly meetings with the professor, and hold office hours to assist students with completing assignments and understanding key concepts of the course.

### Director, BU Quantum <br/> <small><i>September 2025 - Present</i></small>
I am the founder and director of BU Quantum, a quantum computing club at Boston University hosting weekly workshops introducing students to quantum computing concepts from both a theory and computational perspective. I lead all of the workshops, where participants learn about different fundamental concepts and algorithms in the field and then implement them using the Qiskit and Classiq software development kits. I also created weekly notes and addendums hosted on <a href="https://buquantum.org/" target="_blank">the club's website</a> to complement the weekly workshops.

### Director of Engineering, BU Hack4Impact <br/> <small><i>December 2024 - Present</i></small>
As part of this role, I co-lead BU Hack4Impact's Impact Program with the Director of Product, managing 3-4 teams of student interns working on web development projects. I focus primarily on the software development side, hiring software engineers to populate the four teams and advising them on the expectations and responsibilities of their roles. The other part of my role involves instructing and managing weekly workshops covering web development and essential programming skills for students (primarily CS majors) aiming to establish a foothold in the field of software engineering for BU Hack4Impact's Junior Development Team.

## Past Positions

### Software Engineer, CyQuant <br/> <small><i>May 2025 - July 2025</i></small>
I worked as a software engineer at CyQuant, a cyber risk insurance startup, in Paris. My primary task was to create an algorithm that quantifies insurance questionnaires based on a set of cybersecurity standards. I also rebuilt the <a href="https://cyquant.com" target="_blank">CyQuant website</a> from scratch, adding more modern design elements as well as account and job handling systems.

### Course Assistant, CS112: Introduction to Computer Science 2 <br/> <small><i>September 2024 - May 2025</i></small>
I served as a course assistant for the second semester introductory computer science course at BU, which is taught in Java and focuses on data structures. I took the course in Fall 2023 and received an A. I helped lead a lab section and held office hours to assist students with completing assignments and understanding key concepts of the course.

### Lead Software Engineer, BU Hack4Impact <br/> <small><i>July 2024 - December 2024</i></small>
I served as lead software engineer for one of BU Hack4Impact's Impact Teams, a student-led 501(c)(3) that develops software for nonprofits to meet their humanitarian needs. I worked to revamp the website of the BU Center for Gender, Sexuality & Activism from the ground up over the course of the fall semester, managing a software development team comprised of myself and a few other software engineers. I also helped teach web development workshops for BU Hack4Impact's Junior Development Team during the semester.
