            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">I am a first-year student studying mathematics and computer science at Boston
                University. While I am
                interested in a multitude of CS topics, my recent research interest has been quantum computing. In my senior year of high school, I
                served as a quantum outreach ambassador for Qubit by Qubit after taking their Introduction to Quantum
                Computing
                online course. Since then, I have began doing quantum computing research by working on a handful of research projects for different quantum computing companies. You can read more about my projects and classes below.</p>

                    <h4><i>April 2nd-April 19th, 2024</i></h4>
                    <p>For my CC102 class, I created a fictional travel website for Dante's <i>Inferno</i> that contains information about all nine circles of Hell along with tongue-and-cheek tips about things to do or note there. This was my first major web development project, and is not meant to be any sort of professional or rigorously made website. It was a fun way to work on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills!</p>

                    <h4><i>March 4th-April 12th, 2024</i></h4>
                    <p>For QRISE, the Quantum Research & Industry Skills Exchange, I worked with Katie Emerson, a first-year computer
                        science student at Wellesley College, to create a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees problem using coupled harmonic oscillators as described in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041041" target="_blank">this paper</a>. We were able to create an implementation using the Classiq software development kit that works for up to 10 qubits efficiently, equivalent to 512 columns per tree.</p>

                    <h4><i>February 2nd-4th, 2024 â€” Won Second Place</i></h4>
                    <p>iQuHACK is the annual MIT quantum computing hackathon. Working with four other students from
                        Northeastern and Yale, I investigated the maximum independent set problem with vertices
                        connecting edges up to three times the lattice constant in a square graph. We used Aquila,
                        QuEra's 256-qubit quantum computer, along with Bloqade, QuEra's software development kit. I did
                        most of the programming for the team, using both Julia to perform classical simulations and
                        Python to interact with the quantum hardware.</p>
