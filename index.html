                    <p>I participated in YQuantum 2025, the annual Yale quantum computing hackathon, to investigate the viability of a recursive search maximum independent set algorithm for graph coloring and its applicability to risk minimization in insurance. We used the Los Angeles County Fire Hazard Zones database to simulate 20â€“200 acre zones with a certain wildfire severity level as graphs, creating an algorithmic approach that better ensures that insurance companies diversify their portfolios.</p>

                    <p>I won second place at iQuHACK 2025, the annual MIT quantum computing hackathon. Working with four other students from BU, I investigated the quantum physics of cat qubits, the qubit model used by Alice & Bob in hopes of reducing bit flip errors at the cost of only a small increase of phase flip errors. We put ourselves in the shoes of an Alice & Bob quantum engineer for 24 hours, working on modeling Wigner plots of concepts such as Zeno gates, quantum decoherence, and parametric optimizations.</p>

                    <p>This project is the continuation of my winning project for QRISE 2024. I worked with Classiq, a quantum computing software company, to create a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees algorithm that can run on real quantum hardware for qubit sizes too large to simulate. I created an algorithm that can run for an arbitrary number of qubits, as well as an educational website that introduces the problem and describes my implementation. The algorithm is featured as part of the Classiq <a href="https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library/tree/main/algorithms/glued_trees" target="_blank">library</a> and <a href="https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/glued_trees/glued_trees/" target="_blank">documentation</a>. I also wrote an <a href="https://www.classiq.io/insights/exponential-quantum-speedup-on-even-todays-quantum-computers-glued-trees-algorithm" target="_blank">article</a> for Classiq describing the algorithm.</p>

                    <p>For my CC102 class, I created a fictional travel website for Dante's <i>Inferno</i> that contains information about all nine circles of Hell along with tongue-and-cheek tips about things to do or note there. This was my first major web development project, and is not meant to be any sort of professional or rigorously made website. It was a fun way to work on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills! The website was featured in the final issue of the BU Core newsletter for Spring 2024.</p>

                    <p>I was selected as a winner of QRISE 2024, the Quantum Research & Industry Skills Exchange. I worked with Katie Emerson, a first-year computer
                        science student at Wellesley College, to create a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees problem using coupled harmonic oscillators as described in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041041" target="_blank">this paper</a>. We were able to create an implementation using the Classiq software development kit that works for up to 10 qubits efficiently, equivalent to 512 columns per tree. As a winner of the research exchange, I had the opportunity to present our results to Classiq on May 28th, 2024.</p>

                    <p>I won second place at iQuHACK 2024, the annual MIT quantum computing hackathon. Working with four other students from
                        Northeastern and Yale, I investigated the maximum independent set problem with vertices
                        connecting edges up to three times the lattice constant in a square graph. We used Aquila,
                        QuEra's 256-qubit quantum computer, along with Bloqade, QuEra's software development kit. I did
                        most of the programming for the team, using both Julia to perform classical simulations and
                        Python to interact with the quantum hardware.</p>

Works by Voltaire, Kant, Austen, Shelley, the English Romantic Poets, Beethoven, Goethe, Whitman, Dickinson, and Douglass are included.
